        <h4>In today’s connected world, everyone benefits from advanced cybersecurity solutions. At an individual level, a cybersecurity attack can result in everything from identity theft, to extortion attempts, to the loss of important data like family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure like power plants, hospitals, and financial service companies. Securing these and other organizations is essential to keeping our society functioning.In order to improve cybersecurity, we need to shift from a capabilities-only mindset to one that is risk-based. This entails identifying, classifying, and focusing on particular categories of cyber risk—those that actually represent a risk to the entire organization in both the digital and physical domains—as well as implementing the appropriate cyber controls unique to each risk. Using real data to its fullest potential, the risk-based method quantifies and analyzes prospective cyber risks and countermeasures before a genuine attack materializes, modeling and refining solutions.</h4>

      <h2>What is cyber Attack?</h2>
      <p >A cyberattack is a malicious and deliberate attempt by an individual or organization to breach the information system of another individual or organization. Usually, the attacker seeks some type of benefit from disrupting the victim’s network.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;color: #333; line-height: 1.6;">Kenya has seen a rise in the frequency, scale, and sophistication of cyber attacks on its critical information infrastructure. In the period between July 2022 and June 2023, the National KE-CIRT/CC detected more than 855 million cyber threats, placing Kenya among the top three most targeted countries in the region. </p>

    <br>
    <h3><u>Common Sources of Cyber Threats</u></h3>
    <p>Here are common sources of cyber threats against organisations</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Cybercriminals:</b>These individuals or groups are primarily motivated by financial gain. They employ tactics such as phishing, ransomware, and malware to steal sensitive data, demand ransoms, or exploit organizational resources.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Nation_State Actors:</b>State-sponsored hackers often target organizations for espionage, intellectual property theft, or to disrupt operations. These attacks are typically sophisticated and well-funded, aiming to gather strategic information or sabotage critical infrastructure</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Hacktivists:</b>These individuals or groups carry out attacks for ideological, political, or social reasons. They often aim to deface websites, leak sensitive information, or disrupt services to draw attention to their causes.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Third-Party Vendors and Supply Chain:</b>Vendors and suppliers with weak security measures can become entry points for attackers. Compromising these third parties can allow attackers to gain access to the primary organization’s systems and data.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Malicious insiders:</b>Insiders, such as current or former employees, contractors, or business partners, can pose significant threats. They might misuse their access to organizational systems and data intentionally or accidentally, leading to data breaches or other security incidents.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><u>Cyber Security Solutions </u></h3>
    <br>
    <p><b>Antivirus and Anti-Malware Software:</b>These programs detect, prevent, and remove malware, including viruses, worms, and Trojans. They offer real-time protection and regular system scans to identify and mitigate threats</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Firewalls:<br></b><i>Network Firewalls:</i> <br>Act as a barrier between the internal network and external sources, monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.<br>
                                                 <i>Web Application Firewalls (WAF):</i><br> Protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet</p>
   <br>
                                                 <p><b>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):</b><br><i>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): </i>Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and known threats, alerting administrators when such activity is detected.<br><i>Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS): </i><br>Similar to IDS but can also take action to prevent detected threats, such as blocking traffic or resetting connections.</p>
   <br>
   <p><b>Encryption Solutions:</b><br><i>Data Encryption: </i><br>Encrypts data at rest and in transit to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.<br><i>End-to-End Encryption: </i><br>Ensures that data is encrypted from the sender to the receiver, making it unreadable by third parties.</p>
  <br>
  <p><b>Cloud Security Solutions:</b>Protect cloud-based infrastructure, applications, and data. This includes cloud access security brokers (CASBs), secure web gateways (SWGs), and cloud workload protection platforms (CWPPs).</p>
  <br>
  <p><b>Security Awareness Training:</b>Programs designed to educate employees about the importance of cybersecurity, recognizing phishing attempts, safe internet practices, and how to handle sensitive information securely</p>
  <br>
  <p><b>Advanced Bot Protection –</b>Prevent business logic attacks from all access points – websites, mobile apps and APIs. Gain seamless visibility and control over bot traffic to stop online fraud through account takeover or competitive price scraping.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><b><u>Notable Cyber Attack Cases </u></b></p>
  <br>
  <P>Here are some notable cases of cyber attacks, illustrating the diversity and sophistication of modern cyber threats in Kenya and around the globe:</P>
  <br>
  <p><b>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack in Kenya:</b>In July 2023, Kenya experienced a major DDoS attack that disrupted critical services for several hours. This attack affected the e-Citizen platform, M-Pesa, Kenya Power, and Kenya Railways, among others. The attack was believed to be orchestrated by a group called Anonymous Sudan.</p>
  <br>
  <p><b>Chinese Hackers Targeting Kenyan Agencies:</b>In May 2023, it was reported that Chinese hackers had targeted various Kenyan government agencies. These attacks were part of a broader pattern of cyber espionage aimed at extracting sensitive information</p>
  <br>
  <p><b>Twitter Bitcoin Scam (2020)</b>High-profile Twitter accounts were hijacked to promote a Bitcoin scam through social engineering techniques. This incident raised significant concerns about social media security and the potential for widespread misinformation campaigns​ </p>
 <br>
 <b>Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack (2021)</b>Conducted by the DarkSide group, this attack disrupted fuel supplies across the Eastern U.S. Colonial Pipeline shut down operations to contain the ransomware, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in infrastructure and prompting federal cybersecurity responses​ .</p>
 <br>
 <p><b>SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack (2020)</b>A sophisticated attack attributed to Russian state actors, it inserted malicious code into SolarWinds' Orion software, impacting numerous government agencies and major companies. The attack emphasized vulnerabilities in software supply chains​ </p>
 <br>
 <p><b>WannaCry Ransomware Attack (2017)</b>The WannaCry ransomware attack infected hundreds of thousands of computers globally, encrypting files and demanding a ransom in Bitcoin. It exploited the EternalBlue vulnerability in Windows, affecting major sectors including the UK's NHS, which suffered severe disruptions in healthcare services​ </p>
